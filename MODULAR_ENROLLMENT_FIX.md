# Modular Enrollment Course Filtering Fix

## Problem
When students enrolled in modular programs with specific courses (e.g., Mechanical Engineering 101 and Advance Mechanics Method 2), they were seeing all courses in the module instead of only the courses they enrolled in.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the `enrollment_courses` table records were not being created correctly during modular enrollment, and the course filtering logic needed to be enhanced to handle missing records and fallback scenarios.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Course Filtering Logic
Updated `StudentDashboardController` methods:
- `getModuleCourses()` - Added proper filtering for modular enrollments
- `module()` - Added proper filtering for modular enrollments
- Added `ensureEnrollmentCourseRecords()` helper method to create missing course records

### 2. Fixed Course Enrollment Creation
Updated `StudentRegistrationController`:
- Added duplicate prevention when creating enrollment course records
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed the course enrollment logic in `submitModularEnrollment()`

### 3. Created Fix Command
Created `FixModularEnrollmentCourses` Artisan command:
- Fixes existing modular enrollments missing course records
- Prevents duplicate course enrollments
- Can fix specific enrollments or all modular enrollments

## How It Works Now

### For Modular Enrollments:
1. When a student enrolls in specific courses, records are created in `enrollment_courses` table
2. When accessing course content, the system filters courses based on these records
3. If records are missing, it falls back to registration data
4. If no specific courses were selected, it shows all module courses

### Database Tables Involved:
- `enrollments` - Main enrollment record
- `enrollment_courses` - Links enrollment to specific courses
- `registrations` - Contains original selection data (`selected_modules` field)

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Existing Enrollments
Run the fix command to ensure all modular enrollments have proper course records:
```bash
php artisan modular:fix-courses
```

### 2. Test New Enrollments
1. Create a new modular enrollment
2. Select specific courses during enrollment
3. Log in and verify only selected courses appear

### 3. Verify Filtering
1. Log in as a student with modular enrollment
2. Navigate to the course/program
3. Click on modules - should only show enrolled courses
4. Full package students should see all courses

## Files Modified
- `app/Http/Controllers/StudentDashboardController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/StudentRegistrationController.php`
- `app/Console/Commands/FixModularEnrollmentCourses.php` (new)

## Command Usage
```bash
# Fix all modular enrollments
php artisan modular:fix-courses

# Fix specific enrollment
php artisan modular:fix-courses --enrollment-id=123
```
