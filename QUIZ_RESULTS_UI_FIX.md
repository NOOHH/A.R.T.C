# Quiz Results Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Back Button Navigation Issue**
   - **Problem:** The back button was sending users back to the quiz taking page instead of the content page
   - **Fix:** Modified the `goBack()` function to directly navigate to the content page or dashboard instead of using browser history

2. **Retake Quiz Button Removal**
   - **Problem:** The retake quiz button was causing bugs
   - **Fix:** Completely removed the retake quiz button and its associated functionality from the results page

3. **Score Percentage Display**
   - **Problem:** Scores were displaying as 0.0% even when answers were correct
   - **Fix:** Added score recalculation logic that uses the correct_answers and total_questions fields when the score is zero

## Files Modified

1. `resources/views/student/quiz/results.blade.php`
   - Fixed back button navigation
   - Removed retake quiz button and functionality
   - Enhanced score percentage display

2. `resources/views/student/content/view.blade.php`
   - Fixed score display in the quiz attempts table

## Implementation Details

### Back Button Fix
```javascript
function goBack() {
    // Instead of using history.back() which might send user back to quiz taking page,
    // navigate directly to dashboard or content page if available
    @if(isset($contentId) && $contentId)
        window.location.href = "{{ route('student.content.view', $contentId ?? 0) }}";
    @else
        window.location.href = "{{ route('student.dashboard') }}";
    @endif
}
```

### Score Calculation Fix
```php
@php
    // Ensure score is calculated properly - if we have a total_questions value
    if ($attempt->score <= 0 && $attempt->total_questions > 0 && isset($attempt->correct_answers)) {
        $calculatedScore = ($attempt->correct_answers / $attempt->total_questions) * 100;
        echo number_format($calculatedScore, 1) . '%';
    } else {
        echo number_format($attempt->score, 1) . '%';
    }
@endphp
```

## Testing

- Verified that the back button now correctly navigates to the content page or dashboard
- Confirmed that the retake quiz button is no longer present, preventing related bugs
- Tested that scores now display correctly based on the actual correct answers ratio
