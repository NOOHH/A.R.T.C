# SmartPrep Refactor Progress

## ✅ Completed
1. **Composer Namespaces**: Added PSR-4 namespaces for Platform\\, Clients\\ARTC\\, Modules\\.
2. **Directory Structure**: Created modular folder structure for multi-tenant platform.
3. **Database**: Fixed tenants table error by running migration and creating ARTC tenant record.
4. **Service Providers**: Created and registered SmartPrepServiceProvider, ArtcServiceProvider, LmsServiceProvider.
5. **Routes Working**: Platform routes `/platform/health` and `/platform/debug` are registered and visible in `artisan route:list`.

## ⚠️ Discovery: Existing SmartPrep System
Found existing SmartPrep routes and controllers (e.g., `Smartprep\HomepageController`) already in the system. This means there's already a multi-tenant platform partially built. Our new architecture is using `/platform/*` routes to avoid conflicts.

## 🎯 Current Status & Next Steps
**Architecture Foundation**: ✅ Complete
- New namespaces work: Platform\\, Clients\\ARTC\\, Modules\\
- Service providers load and register routes successfully
- Existing SmartPrep system coexists with new platform layer

**Immediate Next Actions**:
1. **Route Migration**: Extract ARTC-specific routes from root `routes/web.php` into `clients/ARTC/routes/`
2. **Discovery Analysis**: Investigate existing SmartPrep system architecture to determine:
   - What's already built vs what needs to be built
   - How to integrate vs replace existing components
   - Whether to migrate existing SmartPrep to new Platform\\ namespace
3. **Client Modularization**: Move ARTC controllers/models under Clients\\ARTC\\ namespace
4. **Integration Strategy**: Decide how new Platform layer interacts with existing SmartPrep

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
```
├── Platform\\ (NEW) → Multi-tenant core orchestration layer
├── Clients\\ARTC\\ → Legacy ARTC implementation encapsulated  
├── Modules\\ → Shared LMS/CMS feature modules
├── Smartprep\\ (EXISTING) → Existing SmartPrep controllers/system
└── App\\ → Original Laravel application layer
```

## 🧪 Verification Commands
```bash
# Verify platform routes are loaded
php artisan route:list | findstr platform

# Should show:
# GET|HEAD  platform/debug .... platform.debug
# GET|HEAD  platform/health ... platform.health

# Manual test (start server first)
php artisan serve
# Then visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/platform/health
```

## 📋 Technical Notes
- Service providers are working correctly (show up in route:list)
- Tests fail because test environment may not call service provider boot methods
- Existing SmartPrep system uses different namespace/pattern than our Platform approach
- Need to determine integration vs migration strategy for existing vs new architecture
