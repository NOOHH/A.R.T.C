## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. **Added Section Support to Form Requirements**

- **Database Migration**: Added `section_name` field to `form_requirements` table
- **Updated Field Type Enum**: Added 'section' as a valid field type
- **Model Updates**: Updated `FormRequirement` model to include `section_name` in fillable attributes

### 2. **Enhanced Admin Settings Interface**

- **Section Field in Form Builder**: Added section name input field before field name in admin settings
- **Dynamic Field Type Handling**: Added 'section' option to field type dropdown
- **JavaScript Handler**: Added `handleFieldTypeChange()` function to show/hide appropriate fields based on selection
- **Form Validation**: Updated save logic to handle section fields differently (only section_name required)

### 3. **Updated Dynamic Form Component**

- **Section Rendering**: Modified `dynamic-enrollment-form.blade.php` to properly render section headers
- **Section Type Detection**: Added logic to detect `field_type === 'section'` and render as headers
- **Improved Styling**: Enhanced section headers with better Bootstrap styling (h4 with border-bottom)

### 4. **Updated Registration Controllers**

- **Validation Skip**: Modified `StudentRegistrationController` to skip section fields during validation
- **Data Processing**: Updated form processing to ignore section fields when saving registration data
- **Dynamic Fields Support**: Ensured section fields don't interfere with dynamic field processing

### 5. **Sample Data**

- **Created Seeder**: Added `SampleFormRequirementsSeeder` with example sections:
  - Personal Information (with phone_number, emergency_contact)
  - Educational Background (with highest_education dropdown)
  - Documents (with TOR and diploma file uploads)

### 6. **Database Structure**

- **Added Dynamic Fields Column**: Ensured `registrations` table has `dynamic_fields` JSON column
- **Updated Migrations**: Created migrations to handle both new and existing databases

## How to Use the Section Feature

### In Admin Settings:

1. **Go to Admin Settings → Student → Registration Form**
2. **Click "Add New Requirement"**
3. **Select "Section" from Field Type dropdown**
4. **Enter Section Name** (e.g., "Personal Information")
5. **Choose Program Type** (Complete, Modular, or Both)
6. **Click Save Requirements**

### Result:
- Section headers will appear as styled headings in the registration form
- Fields grouped under each section will be visually organized
- Section fields won't be validated or saved as form data (they're just visual organizers)

### Dynamic Registration Form:
- Students will see organized sections with clear headers
- Each section groups related fields together
- Maintains proper validation for all input fields
- Supports all existing field types (text, email, file, select, etc.)

The system now supports both section headers and regular form fields, providing a clean and organized registration experience for students while maintaining full administrative control over form structure.
