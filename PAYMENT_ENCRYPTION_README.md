# Payment Encryption Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds encryption to sensitive payment data including QR codes, reference numbers, and other sensitive information when they are stored in the database.

## What's Encrypted

### 1. Reference Numbers
- **Field**: `reference_number` in the `payments` table
- **Encryption**: Automatic encryption/decryption using Laravel's `Crypt` facade
- **Method**: Uses accessor/mutator pattern in the Payment model

### 2. Notes and Rejection Reasons
- **Fields**: `notes` and `rejection_reason` in the `payments` table
- **Encryption**: Automatic encryption/decryption using Laravel's `Crypt` facade
- **Method**: Uses accessor/mutator pattern in the Payment model

### 3. Payment Details (Enhanced)
- **Field**: `payment_details` JSON field in the `payments` table
- **Encryption**: Sensitive fields within the JSON are encrypted
- **Method**: Automatic encryption/decryption through model accessors

**Encrypted fields in payment_details:**
- `qr_code_data` - QR code data
- `qr_code_path` - QR code file paths
- `payment_proof_path` - Payment proof file paths
- `reference_number` - Reference numbers within payment details
- `payment_method_name` - Payment method names
- `transaction_id` - Transaction IDs

## Implementation Details

### Payment Model Changes
The `app/Models/Payment.php` model has been updated with:

1. **Reference Number Encryption**:
   ```php
   public function setReferenceNumberAttribute($value)
   public function getReferenceNumberAttribute($value)
   ```

2. **Notes Encryption**:
   ```php
   public function setNotesAttribute($value)
   public function getNotesAttribute($value)
   ```

3. **Rejection Reason Encryption**:
   ```php
   public function setRejectionReasonAttribute($value)
   public function getRejectionReasonAttribute($value)
   ```

4. **Payment Details Encryption**:
   ```php
   public function setPaymentDetailsAttribute($value)
   public function getPaymentDetailsAttribute($value)
   ```

5. **Important Fix**: Removed the `'payment_details' => 'array'` cast to allow custom encryption handling

### Controller Updates
The following controllers have been updated to work with the new encryption:

1. **StudentPaymentModalController.php** - Removed manual `json_encode()` calls
2. **PaymentController.php** - Removed manual `json_encode()` calls  
3. **StudentPaymentController.php** - Removed manual `json_encode()` calls
4. **AdminController.php** - Added `transaction_date` field to payment detail responses

### Database Migrations
Two migrations have been created:

1. **`2025_08_04_193339_add_encrypted_fields_to_payments_table.php`** - Adds encrypted fields
2. **`2025_08_04_194227_encrypt_existing_payment_data.php`** - Encrypts existing data

## How It Works

### Automatic Encryption
When data is saved to the database:
1. The model's mutator methods automatically encrypt sensitive data
2. Encrypted data is stored in the database
3. No changes needed in controllers - encryption is transparent

### Automatic Decryption
When data is retrieved from the database:
1. The model's accessor methods automatically decrypt data
2. Decrypted data is returned to the application
3. Views and controllers receive the original, unencrypted data

## Security Features

1. **Laravel's Built-in Encryption**: Uses AES-256-CBC encryption
2. **App Key Protection**: Encryption is tied to the application's encryption key
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of decryption failures
4. **Transparent Operation**: No changes needed in existing code
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All sensitive payment data is encrypted

## Testing

The encryption has been tested and verified working:

```bash
# Test encryption functionality
php artisan test:payment-encryption
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ New payments are automatically encrypted
- ✅ Encrypted data can be decrypted properly
- ✅ Existing data can be encrypted via migration
- ✅ Encryption is transparent to application code
- ✅ Payment details JSON field is properly encrypted
- ✅ All sensitive fields are encrypted (reference_number, notes, rejection_reason, payment_details)

## Usage

### For Developers
No changes needed in existing code. The encryption is completely transparent:

```php
// This will automatically encrypt the reference number
$payment = Payment::create([
    'reference_number' => 'REF123456789',
    'notes' => 'Payment notes',
    'payment_details' => [
        'qr_code_data' => 'QR_DATA_HERE',
        'reference_number' => 'REF123456789',
        'payment_proof_path' => 'path/to/proof.jpg'
    ]
]);

// This will automatically decrypt the data
echo $payment->reference_number; // Shows: REF123456789
echo $payment->notes; // Shows: Payment notes
```

### For Database Administrators
- Encrypted data appears as base64-encoded strings in the database
- The `reference_number`, `notes`, and `rejection_reason` fields may contain longer encrypted strings
- The `payment_details` JSON field contains encrypted values for sensitive fields

## Migration Notes

### Running Migrations
If you encounter database migration issues:
1. The encryption will work with existing database structure
2. The field migration can be skipped if there are compatibility issues
3. The existing fields will handle encrypted data

### Encrypting Existing Data
To encrypt existing payment data:
```bash
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_08_04_194227_encrypt_existing_payment_data.php
```

This migration will:
- Check for existing unencrypted data
- Encrypt only data that isn't already encrypted
- Preserve existing encrypted data
- Handle all encrypted fields

## Security Considerations

1. **Backup Encryption Key**: Ensure the Laravel `APP_KEY` is backed up securely
2. **Database Access**: Limit database access to authorized personnel only
3. **Log Monitoring**: Monitor logs for any decryption errors
4. **Key Rotation**: Consider key rotation procedures for production environments
5. **Migration Safety**: The encryption migration is designed to be safe and won't double-encrypt data

## Verification

To verify that encryption is working:

1. **Check new payments**: Create a new payment and verify the database shows encrypted data
2. **Check existing data**: Run the encryption migration to encrypt existing data
3. **Test decryption**: Verify that the application can read encrypted data properly

## Important Notes

### Array Cast Removal
The `'payment_details' => 'array'` cast was removed from the model to allow custom encryption handling. The model now manually handles JSON encoding/decoding to ensure encryption works properly.

### What Gets Encrypted
**Sensitive fields** (automatically encrypted):
- `reference_number` field
- `notes` field
- `rejection_reason` field
- `qr_code_data` in payment_details
- `qr_code_path` in payment_details
- `payment_proof_path` in payment_details
- `reference_number` in payment_details
- `payment_method_name` in payment_details
- `transaction_id` in payment_details

**Non-sensitive fields** (remain unencrypted):
- `uploaded_at` in payment_details
- Standard metadata fields

### Admin Interface Fix
The admin payment pending page now properly displays transaction dates by adding the `transaction_date` field to the payment detail responses.

The encryption implementation has been tested and confirmed working with Laravel 9.52.20.
