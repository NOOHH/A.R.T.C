# Registration Management and OCR Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing JavaScript Functions for Registration Management
**Problem**: `viewRegistrationDetails`, `approveRegistration`, and `rejectRegistration` functions were not defined, causing console errors.

**Solution**: Added global functions to handle registration actions:
- `viewRegistrationDetails(registrationId)` - Triggers the view modal for registration details
- `approveRegistration(registrationId)` - Handles registration approval with confirmation
- `rejectRegistration(registrationId)` - Handles registration rejection with optional reason

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/views/admin/admin-student-registration/admin-student-registration.blade.php`

### 2. OCR Service Integration with File Uploads
**Problem**: File uploads in enrollment forms weren't utilizing the enhanced OCR service capabilities.

**Solution**: Enhanced file upload handling to:
- Process document uploads with OCR in real-time
- Display OCR processing status to users
- Show program suggestions based on document content
- Provide certificate level detection
- Handle OCR processing errors gracefully

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/views/components/dynamic-enrollment-form.blade.php`

### 3. Diploma and Certificate of Graduation Handling
**Problem**: System treated "diploma" and "Cert_of_Grad" as different document types, causing validation issues.

**Solution**: Updated OCR service to normalize diploma uploads:
- Both "diploma" and "Cert_of_Grad" are treated as the same document type
- Enhanced keyword matching for graduation documents
- Added more comprehensive certificate validation terms
- Updated error messages to reflect both diploma and certificate acceptance

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Services/OcrService.php`

## Key Enhancements

### OCR Service Improvements
1. **Enhanced Document Type Validation**:
   - Added normalization for diploma → Cert_of_Grad
   - Expanded keyword matching for graduation documents
   - Improved confidence scoring for document validation

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - More descriptive error messages
   - Graceful degradation when OCR fails
   - Fallback validation options

3. **Real-time Processing**:
   - Immediate OCR feedback during file upload
   - Program suggestions based on document content
   - Certificate level detection and display

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Loading spinners during OCR processing
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Detailed processing messages

2. **Smart Suggestions**:
   - Program recommendations based on educational documents
   - Certificate level detection
   - Validation status with explanations

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Graceful handling of OCR failures
   - Manual verification fallbacks
   - Clear error messaging

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Functions Added
```javascript
function viewRegistrationDetails(registrationId)
function approveRegistration(registrationId)
function rejectRegistration(registrationId)
function processFileWithOCR(file, fieldName, statusDiv)
```

### OCR Service Methods Enhanced
```php
validateDocumentType($ocrText, $documentType)
validateDocumentTypeEnhanced($ocrText, $documentType)
getDocumentTypeError($documentType)
```

### API Endpoints Utilized
- `/admin/validate-file` - Real-time document validation with OCR
- `/admin/registration/{id}/approve` - Registration approval
- `/admin/registration/{id}/reject` - Registration rejection

## Testing Instructions

### Registration Management
1. Go to Admin → Student Registration
2. Test "View", "Approve", and "Reject" buttons
3. Verify modal displays and form submissions work
4. Check that rejection prompts for reason

### OCR Integration
1. Go to enrollment forms (Full or Modular)
2. Upload documents (especially diplomas/certificates)
3. Verify OCR processing status appears
4. Check program suggestions are displayed
5. Test with various document types

### Document Type Validation
1. Upload a diploma file
2. Verify it's accepted as Cert_of_Grad
3. Test with other document types
4. Check error messages are appropriate

## Files Modified Summary
- `resources/views/admin/admin-student-registration/admin-student-registration.blade.php` - Added missing JavaScript functions
- `resources/views/components/dynamic-enrollment-form.blade.php` - Enhanced file upload with OCR integration
- `app/Services/OcrService.php` - Improved document validation and diploma handling

## Status
✅ **Complete** - All JavaScript errors resolved, OCR integration enhanced, diploma handling unified
