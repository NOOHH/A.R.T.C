# A.R.T.C Analytics & Certificate Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Certificate Index View Syntax Error
**Problem**: `syntax error, unexpected token "else", expecting end of file`
**Root Cause**: Leftover template code after `@endpush` directive
**Solution**: Removed orphaned HTML/Blade code from old template that was causing parse errors

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/views/admin/certificates/index.blade.php` - Cleaned up syntax errors

### 2. Analytics Data Tables Not Populating
**Problem**: Missing data for Recently Enrolled, Recent Payments, Recently Completed, and Students Needing Attention tables
**Root Cause**: Backend methods were not implemented to fetch this data
**Solution**: Added comprehensive data fetching methods and updated frontend JavaScript

#### Backend Changes (AdminAnalyticsController.php):

1. **Enhanced getTableData()** - Added new data types:
   - `recentlyEnrolled`
   - `recentPayments` 
   - `recentlyCompleted`

2. **Added getRecentlyEnrolled()** method:
   - Fetches from `enrollments` table with student and program data
   - Applies date and program filters
   - Shows enrollment status and dates
   - Handles missing data gracefully

3. **Added getRecentPayments()** method:
   - Fetches from `payments` table with enrollment relationships
   - Falls back to `payment_history` table if primary table unavailable
   - Shows payment amounts, dates, and status
   - Formats currency properly

4. **Added getRecentlyCompleted()** method:
   - Fetches completed enrollments from `enrollments` table
   - Falls back to `module_completions` for modular progress
   - Shows completion dates and programs
   - Handles both program and module completion tracking

#### Frontend Changes (admin-analytics.blade.php):

1. **Enhanced updateTables()** function:
   - Added calls to new table update functions
   - Maintains existing functionality

2. **Added updateRecentlyEnrolledTable()** function:
   - Populates Recently Enrolled table with proper formatting
   - Shows student name, ID, program, and enrollment date
   - Handles empty data states

3. **Added updateRecentPaymentsTable()** function:
   - Populates Recent Payments table
   - Shows student, program, amount (formatted), and date
