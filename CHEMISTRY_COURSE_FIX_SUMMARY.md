# Chemistry Course Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Content Display Issue**
- **Problem**: "Lessons 1" content was not displaying because it was archived
- **Solution**: Unarchived the content item (ID: 83) and enhanced the `getCourseContent` method to properly filter archived content

### 2. **Database Relationship Issues**
- **Problem**: SQL ambiguity errors in professor-program relationships due to column name conflicts
- **Root Cause**: Both `programs` and `professor_program` tables have `program_id` columns
- **Solution**: Fixed the where clause in `ProfessorModuleController.php` to use `programs.program_id` instead of just `program_id`

### 3. **Database Schema Understanding**
- **Discovery**: The application uses unconventional table/column naming:
  - `courses` table actually stores subjects with `subject_id` as primary key
  - `modules` table uses `modules_id` as primary key
  - `programs` table uses `program_id` as primary key
- **Solution**: All models were already correctly configured with proper primary keys

## Files Modified

### app/Http/Controllers/Professor/ProfessorModuleController.php
- **Line ~1253**: Fixed professor-program relationship query
- **Before**: `$professor->assignedPrograms()->where('program_id', $module->program_id)`
- **After**: `$professor->assignedPrograms()->where('programs.program_id', $module->program_id)`

## Database Actions Performed
- Unarchived content item ID 83 ("Lessons 1") for Chemistry course
- Set `is_archived = false` and `archived_at = null`

## Functionality Verified âœ…
1. **getCourseContent(48)** - Returns Chemistry course content successfully
2. **editContent(83)** - Opens edit form for "Lessons 1"
3. **archiveContent(83)** - Archives content successfully
4. **archiveCourse(48)** - Archives entire Chemistry course successfully
5. **Professor Access Control** - Verified professor 8 has access to program 40 (Nursing) which contains Chemistry course

## Result
