-- Dummy schema file to prevent deployment errors
-- This file has been replaced with Laravel migrations
-- The actual database structure is now managed through Laravel migrations

-- No actual schema content - migrations handle the database structure
-- This prevents the automatic schema loading from failing

-- If you need to load the original schema, use the backup file:
-- database/schema/mysql-schema.sql.backup
