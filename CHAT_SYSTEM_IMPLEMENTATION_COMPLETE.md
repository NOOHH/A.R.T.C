# Chat System Implementation Summary

## Database Changes ✅

### Chats Table
- ✅ `body_cipher` column for encrypted messages
- ✅ `is_read` column to track read status
- ✅ `is_encrypted` column to track encryption status
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance

### Users Table
- ✅ `is_online` column for online status
- ✅ `last_seen` column for last activity timestamp

## Backend Changes ✅

### Models
- ✅ `Chat` model updated with encryption attributes and relationships
- ✅ `User` model updated with online status methods and chat relationships

### Controllers
- ✅ `ChatApiController` updated with proper authentication and error handling
- ✅ `UserController` for user search functionality
- ✅ `ProfessorProgramController` for professor-specific endpoints

### Middleware
- ✅ `SessionAuth` middleware for session-based authentication

### Events
- ✅ `MessageSent` event for real-time message broadcasting
- ✅ `UserOnlineStatusChanged` event for presence updates

### Services
- ✅ `UserOnlineStatusService` for managing online status

### Resources
- ✅ `MessageResource` updated for new Chat model structure
- ✅ `UserResource` includes online status

## API Routes ✅

### Session-based Authentication Routes
- ✅ `GET /api/me` - Get current user info
- ✅ `GET /api/chat/session/users` - Search users by type
- ✅ `GET /api/chat/session/messages` - Get conversation messages
- ✅ `POST /api/chat/session/send` - Send message
- ✅ `GET /api/chat/session/recent` - Get recent conversations
- ✅ `GET /api/professor/assigned-programs` - Get professor's programs

## Frontend Changes ✅

### JavaScript Updates
- ✅ Updated `performRealTimeSearch()` to handle new API structure
- ✅ Added `loadMessages()` function for fetching conversation history
- ✅ Added `displayChatMessages()` function for rendering messages
- ✅ Added `sendMessageToUser()` function for sending messages
- ✅ Added `fetchCurrentUserInfo()` to get user ID when missing
- ✅ Updated authentication headers and error handling

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Encrypted Messages
- Messages are stored encrypted in the `body_cipher` column
- Automatic encryption/decryption through Laravel's attribute casting

### 2. Real-time Presence
- Users can be marked as online/offline
- Last seen timestamps are tracked
- Online status is displayed in user lists

### 3. Proper Authentication
- Session-based authentication for API endpoints
- CSRF protection for all requests
- User authorization checks

### 4. Message Management
- Bi-directional message retrieval
- Read status tracking
- Message history with proper ordering

### 5. Search Functionality
- Real-time user search by name/email
- Role-based filtering (student/professor/admin)
- Online status indicators

## Testing Steps

1. **Login as a professor**
   - Should now have `myId` populated
   - Should be able to search for students
   - No more 401 errors

2. **Search Users**
   - Type in search box should return filtered results
   - Should show online/offline status
   - Should be able to select users for chat

3. **Send Messages**
   - Messages should be sent and displayed immediately
   - Should be encrypted in database
   - Should load conversation history

4. **Message Retrieval**
   - Should load existing messages between users
   - Should mark messages as read when viewed
   - Should handle both directions (sent/received)

## Next Steps

1. **Run the application** and test the chat functionality
2. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors
3. **Test with multiple users** to verify bi-directional messaging
4. **Implement real-time broadcasting** if WebSocket/Pusher is available
5. **Add message notifications** for unread messages
