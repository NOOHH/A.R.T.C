echo str_repeat("=", 70) . "\n\n";

echo "🔧 ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:\n";
echo "❌ Problem: SmartPrep middleware only checked 'smartprep' guard\n";
echo "✅ Solution: Updated middleware to check both 'admin' and 'smartprep' guards\n\n";

echo "🔍 WHAT WAS HAPPENING:\n";
echo "1. ✅ Admin login was successful (we saw it in logs)\n";
echo "2. ✅ Admin was authenticated with 'admin' guard\n";
echo "3. ❌ SmartPrep middleware only checked 'smartprep' guard\n";
echo "4. ❌ Middleware thought admin was not authenticated\n";
echo "5. 🔄 Middleware redirected back to login page\n";
echo "6. 🔄 Created endless redirect loop\n\n";

echo "🛠️ FIXES APPLIED:\n";
echo "✅ Updated Smartprep\\Authenticate middleware\n";
echo "✅ Now checks both Auth::guard('admin') and Auth::guard('smartprep')\n";
echo "✅ Cleared all Laravel caches\n";
echo "✅ Login controller already had correct logic\n\n";

echo "🚀 AUTHENTICATION FLOW NOW:\n";
echo "1. User goes to: http://localhost:8000/smartprep/login\n";
echo "2. Enters: admin@smartprep.com / admin123\n";
echo "3. LoginController finds admin in 'admins' table\n";
echo "4. LoginController authenticates with 'admin' guard\n";
echo "5. LoginController redirects to admin dashboard\n";
echo "6. Middleware checks both guards, finds admin authenticated\n";
echo "7. ✅ Dashboard loads successfully!\n\n";

echo "🎉 READY TO TEST:\n";
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n";
echo "1. 🌐 Open browser and go to: http://localhost:8000/smartprep/login\n";
echo "2. 🔑 Login with:\n";
echo "   📧 Email: admin@smartprep.com\n";
echo "   🔐 Password: admin123\n";
echo "3. ✨ You should be redirected to: /smartprep/admin/dashboard\n";
echo "4. 🎊 Success indicators:\n";
echo "   - Navbar shows 'SmartPrep Admin' instead of 'Guest'\n";
echo "   - Page loads admin dashboard content\n";
echo "   - No redirect back to login\n";
echo "   - Brand name shows: '🚀 ADMIN FIXED & WORKING! 🚀'\n";
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n";

echo "🔧 FOR CLIENT TESTING:\n";
echo "📧 Email: robert@gmail.com\n";
echo "🔐 Password: client123\n";
echo "🎯 Expected: Redirect to /smartprep/dashboard (client dashboard)\n\n";

echo "🐛 IF STILL NOT WORKING:\n";
echo "1. 🧹 Clear ALL browser data (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)\n";
echo "2. 🕵️ Try incognito/private mode\n";
echo "3. 🔄 Restart Laravel server (Ctrl+C then 'php artisan serve')\n";
echo "4. 📱 Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors\n";
echo "5. 🌐 Check Network tab for redirect information\n\n";
