## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Structure:**
- ✅ `status` column for tracking registration states
- ✅ `rejected_fields` JSON column for storing rejection details
- ✅ `resubmitted_at` timestamp column
- ✅ Test data created for development/testing

### **Backend Controllers:**
- ✅ **StudentController**: `getRejectedRegistration()`, `resubmitRegistration()`
- ✅ **AdminController**: `studentRegistrationRejected()`, `studentRegistrationResubmitted()`, `approveRejectedRegistration()`, `undoRejection()`

### **Frontend Components:**
- ✅ **JavaScript Functions**: `showRejectedModal()`, `resubmitRegistration()`
- ✅ **Blade Templates**: Student dashboard, admin views, edit forms
- ✅ **Bootstrap Modals**: Professional UI with responsive design

### **Route Definitions:**
- ✅ `admin.student.registration.rejected`
- ✅ `admin.student.registration.resubmitted`
- ✅ `student.registration.rejected`
- ✅ `student.registration.resubmit`

## 🚀 **System Workflow**

### **Rejection to Resubmission Process:**
1. **Admin rejects registration** → Status: `rejected`
2. **Student views rejection details** → Modal shows rejection info
3. **Student edits registration** → Form pre-populated with data
4. **Student resubmits** → Status: `resubmitted`
5. **Admin reviews resubmission** → Approve or reject again
6. **Final approval** → Status: `approved`

### **Admin Management Process:**
1. **View rejected registrations** → Complete list with action buttons
2. **Manage resubmitted registrations** → Dedicated interface
3. **Quick actions available** → Approve, reject, undo operations
4. **Comprehensive navigation** → Easy access via sidebar menu
