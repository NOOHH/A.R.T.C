# Database Fix - Professor Profile Dynamic Data Column

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'dynamic_data' in 'field list'`

### Root Cause
The `dynamic_data` column was missing from the professors table, but the code was trying to save dynamic form data to this column.

### Solution Applied
1. **Created Migration**: `2025_08_03_023555_add_dynamic_data_to_professors_table.php`
2. **Added Column**: `dynamic_data` as JSON type with nullable constraint
3. **Applied Migration**: Successfully added the column to the professors table
4. **Verified Model**: Confirmed Professor model already had proper JSON casting

### Database Schema Update
```sql
ALTER TABLE professors ADD COLUMN dynamic_data JSON NULL AFTER profile_photo;
```

### Column Details
- **Type**: JSON
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Purpose**: Store dynamic form fields and additional professor data
- **Casting**: Automatically cast to/from array in Laravel

### Current Professors Table Structure
```
professor_id (primary)
admin_id
professor_name
professor_first_name
professor_last_name
professor_email
professor_password
referral_code
profile_photo
dynamic_data (NEW)
professor_archived
created_at
updated_at
```

### Testing Results
- âœ… Migration applied successfully
- âœ… Column exists and accessible
- âœ… JSON data can be saved and retrieved
- âœ… Profile update functionality now works
- âœ… No more database errors

### Impact
- **Profile Editing**: Now fully functional
- **Dynamic Fields**: Can store custom form data
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained with nullable field
- **Data Integrity**: Proper JSON validation and casting

The professor profile system is now completely functional with proper database support for dynamic data storage! ðŸŽ‰
