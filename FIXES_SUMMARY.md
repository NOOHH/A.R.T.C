# A.R.T.C System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Route [admin.students.export] not defined
**Problem**: Missing route definition for student export functionality
**Solution**: Added the missing route in `routes/web.php`

```php
Route::middleware(['admin.director.auth'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin/students', [AdminStudentListController::class, 'index'])->name('admin.students.index');
    Route::get('/admin/students/export', [AdminStudentListController::class, 'export'])->name('admin.students.export');
    // ...add any other /admin/students routes here...
});
```

**Files Modified**:
- `routes/web.php` (line ~1435)

---

### 2. Column 'status' not found in enrollments table
**Problem**: Code was referencing a non-existent `status` column in the enrollments table
**Solution**: Updated all references to use the correct `enrollment_status` column

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/CertificateController.php`
  - Changed `where('status', 'completed')` to `where('enrollment_status', 'completed')`
  - Changed `orderBy('completed_at', 'desc')` to `orderBy('updated_at', 'desc')`

- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/EnrollmentManagementController.php`
  - Changed `where('status', 'pending')` to `where('enrollment_status', 'pending')`
  - Changed `where('status', 'completed')` to `where('enrollment_status', 'completed')`

---

### 3. Certificate Management Enhancement
**Problem**: Certificate management was not properly based on student progress
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive progress-based certificate management system

#### Enhanced CertificateController
- Added `calculateStudentProgress()` method to track student completion
- Modified `index()` method to show students based on their progress
- Now considers module and course completions
- Shows eligibility based on 80%+ completion or full completion

#### Updated Student Model
- Added `courseCompletions()` relationship
- Enhanced existing relationships for better certificate tracking

#### Redesigned Certificate Management View
- `resources/views/admin/certificates/index.blade.php` - Complete redesign
- Progress-based dashboard with statistics
- Visual progress indicators
- Student cards showing completion status
- Eligibility-based certificate generation

**New Features**:
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Student completion statistics
- Module and course completion tracking
- Eligibility determination (80%+ progress)
- Visual progress bars and status indicators
- Responsive card-based layout

## Database Schema Verification

The enrollments table contains the following relevant columns:
- `enrollment_id` (Primary Key)
- `enrollment_status` (Status tracking)
- `student_id` (Foreign Key)
- `program_id` (Foreign Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key)
- And 31 other columns for comprehensive tracking

## Testing Results

### Route Testing
✅ Route `admin.students.export` now exists and is properly registered
✅ Route points to `AdminStudentListController@export`

### Database Testing

✅ Found 14 approved enrollments in test database
✅ No more "Unknown column 'status'" errors
