Machine Design Principles and Engineering

This document covers fundamental concepts in mechanical engineering design with special characters: résistance, torsión, and material symbols ©®™.

Key Topics:
1. Stress Analysis - Understanding how materials respond to forces
2. Fatigue Design - Preventing failure under repeated loading
3. Material Selection - Choosing appropriate materials for applications
4. Safety Factors - Engineering margins for safe operation

The design process involves multiple considerations including:
- Load calculations and stress distribution
- Material properties and behavioral characteristics  
- Manufacturing constraints and cost considerations
- Environmental factors and operating conditions

This content should generate multiple choice questions about mechanical engineering design principles and methodologies used in practice.
