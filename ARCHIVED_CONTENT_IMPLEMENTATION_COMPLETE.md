# Archived Content Management System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
I have completely overhauled your archived modules page to create a professional, mobile-responsive archived content management system that handles both modules and course content.

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CSS Design (`public/css/admin/admin-modules-archived.css`)
- **Professional UI**: Modern card-based design with gradients and smooth animations
- **Course Sections**: Expandable/collapsible course sections with professional headers
- **Content Type Icons**: Distinct icons and colors for different content types (modules, assignments, quizzes, tests, links)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Professional filter section with search, type filtering, and sorting
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Beautiful stat cards showing archived content counts

### 2. Enhanced Backend (`app/Http/Controllers/AdminModuleController.php`)
