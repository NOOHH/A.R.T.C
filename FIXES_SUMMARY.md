# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

**Problem**: The "Next" button in account registration (step 3) wasn't working properly.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the `validateStep3()` function to properly return boolean values
- Added better validation logic for form fields
- Improved the `nextStep()` function to validate the current step before proceeding
- Added debug logging for better troubleshooting
- Fixed button styling states (enabled/disabled)

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/views/registration/Modular_enrollment.blade.php`

### 2. Admin Settings Form Requirements Not Saving ✅

**Solution**:
- Improved error handling in `saveFormRequirements()` JavaScript function
- Added better response logging and error messages
- Enhanced `loadFormRequirements()` function with better error handling
- Added proper sorting by `sort_order` field
- Fixed form data serialization issues

**Files Modified**:

### 3. Homepage Customization System ✅
**Problem**: Admin settings couldn't modify colors and text for different homepage sections.

**Solution**:
- Added new routes for homepage settings: `/admin/settings/homepage`
- Created `getHomepageSettings()` and `saveHomepageSettings()` methods in AdminSettingsController
- Added `getHomepageCustomStyles()` and `getHomepageContent()` methods in SettingsHelper
- Created comprehensive homepage customization UI with sections for:
  - Hero Section (background, text colors, title, subtitle, button)
  - Programs Section (background, text colors, title, subtitle)
  - Modalities Section (background, text colors, title, subtitle)
  - About Section (background, text colors, title, subtitle)

**Solution**:
- Redesigned the "Home" tab in admin settings with proper sections

### Error Handling

- Improved user feedback with proper success/error messages
- Better validation and form state management

### Code Organization
