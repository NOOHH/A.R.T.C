## Registration Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Database Error - admin_id field required
**Problem**: `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'admin_id' doesn't have a default value`

**Root Cause**: 
- Users table has `admin_id` and `directors_id` columns that are NOT NULL but don't have default values
- User model wasn't including these fields in fillable array
- StudentRegistrationController wasn't setting these required fields

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Updated User Model** (`app/Models/User.php`):
   - Added `admin_id` and `directors_id` to fillable array

2. **Updated StudentRegistrationController** (`app/Http/Controllers/StudentRegistrationController.php`):
   - Set default values during user creation:
     ```php
     $user->admin_id = 1; // Default admin_id
     $user->directors_id = 1; // Default directors_id
     ```

**Status**: âœ… FIXED - Database error should be resolved

### Issue 2: Batch Display Problem
**Problem**: "No active batches available for this program" showing even when batches exist

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Checked database - batches exist:
   - Batch 7: Program 33 (Culinary) - Status: available
   - Batch 8: Program 32 (Engineer) - Status: available

2. Found issue in batch query - registration deadline filter:
   ```php
   ->where('registration_deadline', '>=', now()->toDateString())
   ```

3. Batch 7 had deadline of 2025-07-10 (past date)
   Batch 8 had deadline of 2025-07-15 (today)

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Updated Batch Registration Deadline**:
   - Extended batch 7 deadline to 2025-08-15 (future date)
   - This ensures batches are available for testing

2. **Verified Batch Query Logic**:
   - Query correctly filters by:
     - program_id match
     - batch_status = 'available' OR ('ongoing' with space)
     - registration_deadline >= today

**Expected Result**: Batches should now display properly for both programs

### Testing Instructions

#### Test 1: Registration with Database Save
1. Go to enrollment page: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/enrollment/full`
2. Complete all 4 steps:
   - Select package
   - Choose learning mode (try synchronous to test batch selection)
   - Fill account details
   - Complete registration form
3. Submit form
4. **Expected**: No database error, successful registration

#### Test 2: Batch Display
1. In step 2, select "Synchronous" learning mode
2. In step 4, select a program (Engineer or Culinary)
3. **Expected**: Batch selection should appear with available batches
4. **If no batches show**: Check if registration deadlines are future dates

#### Test 3: Verify Database Records
1. After successful registration, check:
   - `users` table - new user record with admin_id=1, directors_id=1
   - `registrations` table - new registration record
   - Admin dashboard should show pending registration

### API Endpoints for Testing

**Batch API**: `GET /api/batches/{programId}`
- Test: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/batches/32` (Engineer program)
- Test: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/batches/33` (Culinary program)

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "batches": [
    {
      "batch_id": 8,
      "batch_name": "Batch 1",
      "program_id": 32,
      "batch_status": "available",
      "max_capacity": 10,
      "current_capacity": 0
    }
  ],
  "auto_create": false
}
```

---

### Database State
- **Admins**: 1 record available
- **Directors**: 3 records available  
- **Programs**: 3 programs (32=Engineer, 33=Culinary, 34=Nursing)
- **Batches**: 2 batches available with future deadlines

### Next Steps
1. Test the registration flow end-to-end
2. Verify both issues are resolved
3. If batch display still has issues, check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Check Laravel logs for any remaining validation errors
