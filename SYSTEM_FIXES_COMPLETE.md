# A.R.T.C System Fixes - Complete Resolution ✅

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Missing Homepage View** - RESOLVED
**Error**: `View [homepage] not found. InvalidArgumentException`

**Root Cause**: The `HomepageController` was trying to return a view called `homepage.blade.php` that didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created `resources/views/homepage.blade.php` with:
- Modern responsive design using Bootstrap 5
- Hero section with gradient background
- Dynamic program listing from database
- Features section highlighting A.R.T.C benefits
- Call-to-action section for enrollment
- Proper integration with existing layout system

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `resources/views/homepage.blade.php` - Created complete homepage view
- ✅ Uses existing `layouts/navbar.blade.php` layout
- ✅ Integrates with `UIHelper` and `SettingsHelper` classes
- ✅ Responsive design with Bootstrap 5 components

### 2. ✅ **419 Page Expired on Logout** - RESOLVED
**Error**: `419 Page Expired` when clicking logout button

**Root Cause**: CSRF token issues and session management during logout process.

**Solution**: Enhanced logout system with:
- Improved logout method with proper error handling
- Online status tracking during logout
- Better session management and token regeneration
- Multiple logout route support

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/UnifiedLoginController.php` - Enhanced logout method
- ✅ `resources/views/logout-test.blade.php` - Created test page for logout functionality
- ✅ `routes/web.php` - Added logout test route

**Enhanced Logout Features**:
- Proper CSRF token handling
- User online status update on logout
- Error handling for failed logout attempts
- Session flush and token regeneration
- Support for multiple user types (admin, student, professor, director)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Homepage Controller Flow
```php
HomepageController@index -> homepage.blade.php
```

**Data Flow**:
1. Controller fetches non-archived programs from database
2. Retrieves homepage title from settings
3. Passes data to view with proper variable binding
4. View renders with Bootstrap components and responsive design

### Logout System Flow
```php
UnifiedLoginController@logout -> Session Management -> Redirect
```

**Logout Process**:
1. Check for user session and update online status
2. Clear all session data securely
3. Regenerate CSRF token
4. Redirect to homepage with success message
5. Handle any errors gracefully
