/**
 * Fix for "Unsupported operand types: int + string" error in take.blade.php
 * 
 * This script addresses the error that occurs when attempting to add an integer
 * to a string in Blade templates. It ensures all indices and option indexes are
 * properly cast to integers before performing arithmetic operations.
 * 
 * Changes made:
 * 1. Cast $index to (int) before adding 1 in various places
 * 2. Cast $optionIndex to (int) before adding 65 for character codes
 * 3. Cast $index to (int) for comparison operations (=== and >)
 * 
 * These changes prevent PHP 8's strict type checking from raising errors
 * when performing arithmetic on values that might be strings.
