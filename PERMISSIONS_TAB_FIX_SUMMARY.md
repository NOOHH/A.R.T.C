# Permissions Tab Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Permissions Tab Not Showing on Left Side ✅
**Problem:** The permissions tab was not displaying on the left sidebar like other tabs.

**Root Cause:** The permissions section structure was inconsistent with other sections.

**Solution:** 
- Fixed the HTML structure to match other sections
- Changed from `<div id="permissions-settings" class="sidebar-section">` to `<div class="sidebar-section" id="permissions-settings">`
- Added proper section header structure with `<div class="section-header mb-3">`

**Before:**
```html
<div id="permissions-settings" class="sidebar-section" style="display: none;">
    <h3 class="section-title">
        <i class="fas fa-shield-alt me-2"></i>Permissions
    </h3>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="sidebar-section" id="permissions-settings" style="display: none;">
    <div class="section-header mb-3">
        <h5 class="mb-0"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt me-2"></i>Permissions Settings</h5>
    </div>
```

### 2. Settings Not Being Saved ✅
**Problem:** Form submissions for permissions and auth settings were not working.

**Root Cause:** Missing form submission handlers and endpoint configurations.

**Solution:**
- Added missing form submission handlers:
  - `updateAuth(event)` - for login customization
  - `updateDirectorFeatures(event)` - for director permissions
  - `updateProfessorFeatures(event)` - for professor permissions

- Added endpoint configurations in `handleFormSubmission()`:
  ```javascript
  if (settingType === 'auth') endpoint = '/smartprep/dashboard/settings/auth/{{ $selectedWebsite->id ?? 1 }}';
  if (settingType === 'director') endpoint = '/smartprep/dashboard/settings/director/{{ $selectedWebsite->id ?? 1 }}';
  if (settingType === 'professor-features') endpoint = '/smartprep/dashboard/settings/professor-features/{{ $selectedWebsite->id ?? 1 }}';
  ```

### 3. Advanced Tab Still Present ✅
**Problem:** The advanced tab was still showing in some places.

**Solution:** 
- Completely removed the advanced tab button from navigation
- Removed all advanced settings sections
- Removed JavaScript references to advanced functionality
- Updated forms array to exclude advancedForm

## Files Modified

### 1. `resources/views/smartprep/dashboard/customize-website.blade.php`

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed permissions section HTML structure
- Fixed director features section HTML structure  
- Fixed professor features section HTML structure
- Added missing form submission handlers
- Added endpoint configurations for auth, director, and professor features
- Removed all advanced tab references

**Key Additions:**
```javascript
// Form submission handlers
async function updateAuth(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    await handleFormSubmission(event, 'auth', 'Updating auth settings...');
}

async function updateDirectorFeatures(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    await handleFormSubmission(event, 'director', 'Updating director features...');
}

async function updateProfessorFeatures(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    await handleFormSubmission(event, 'professor-features', 'Updating professor features...');
}
```
