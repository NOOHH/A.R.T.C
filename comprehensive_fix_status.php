echo "=========================================\n\n";

echo "‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES:\n";
echo "- AdminPreviewCustomization trait implemented across all controllers\n";
echo "- Mock data system with proper object structures\n";
echo "- Batch Enrollment: Fixed date formatting and missing properties\n";
echo "- Directors: Added full_name, email, hire_date, programs properties\n";
echo "- Quiz Generator: Added course->subject_name, questions, time_limit\n";
echo "- Payment Pending: Fixed database queries and added payment_method\n";
echo "- URL parameter preservation working 100%\n";
echo "- Tenant customization (Test1 branding) working on all successful pages\n\n";

echo "üéØ CURRENT STATUS: 78.9% SUCCESS RATE (15/19 pages)\n\n";

echo "‚úÖ WORKING PAGES (15):\n";
$workingPages = [
    'Dashboard', 'Professors', 'Programs', 'Modules', 'Announcements',
    'Batch Enrollment', 'Analytics', 'Settings', 'Packages', 
    'Payment History', 'Archived Programs', 'FAQ Management',
    'Create New Announcement', 'View Announcement', 'Edit Announcement'

echo "\n‚ùå REMAINING ISSUES (4):\n";
echo "  ‚ùå Students - Object conversion error\n";
echo "  ‚ùå Directors - Object conversion error\n"; 
echo "  ‚ùå Quiz Generator - Missing max_attempts property\n";
echo "  ‚ùå Payment Pending - HTTP 500 (intermittent)\n\n";

echo "üîß RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO ACHIEVE 100%:\n";
echo "1. Fix Students & Directors object conversion by ensuring all nested objects are properly structured\n";
echo "2. Add max_attempts property to Quiz Generator mock data\n";
echo "3. Ensure Payment Pending view database queries are properly handled\n";
echo "4. Run comprehensive validation test\n\n";

echo "üí° KEY INSIGHTS:\n";
echo "- Object conversion errors typically occur when views try to concatenate or echo objects\n";
echo "- Missing property errors are easier to fix by adding the specific property\n";
echo "- The system architecture is solid - just need to complete the mock data\n\n";

echo "üöÄ NEXT STEPS:\n";
echo "1. Add max_attempts to Quiz Generator\n";
echo "2. Debug Students & Directors object issues\n";
echo "3. Validate Payment Pending stability\n";
echo "4. Achieve 100% success rate!\n\n";

echo "The admin preview system is already highly successful with proper Test1 branding\n";
echo "and URL parameter preservation working across 15 pages!\n";
