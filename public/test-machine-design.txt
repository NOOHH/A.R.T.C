Machine Design Fundamentals

This document covers basic machine design principles including stress analysis, material selection, and component design.

Stress Analysis
Stress is force per unit area applied to a material. There are three main types of stress: tensile, compressive, and shear stress.

Material Selection
Engineers must consider factors such as strength, weight, cost, and corrosion resistance when selecting materials for machine components.

Safety Factors
A safety factor is the ratio of ultimate strength to working stress. It ensures safe operation under varying conditions.

Bearing Design
Bearings support rotating shafts and reduce friction. Ball bearings are commonly used for high-speed applications.

Gear Systems
Gears transmit power between rotating shafts. Gear ratio determines the speed and torque relationship.

Welding Processes
Welding creates permanent joints between metal components. Common processes include MIG, TIG, and arc welding.

Heat Treatment
Heat treatment processes can improve material properties such as hardness, toughness, and machinability.
