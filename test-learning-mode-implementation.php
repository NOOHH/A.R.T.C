 * Test file for Learning Mode Implementation

 * 1. Synchronous mode: start date hidden, system controls it (2 weeks from registration)
 * 2. Asynchronous mode: user must input start date
 * 3. Admin controls for enabling/disabling learning modes per plan
 * 4. Pending batch visibility in admin dashboard
 * 5. Working save changes button in admin settings
