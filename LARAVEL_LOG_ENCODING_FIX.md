# Laravel Log Encoding Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
Laravel logs were displaying garbled characters (like `Ã±Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³Ãº` instead of `ñáéíóú`) due to improper UTF-8 encoding handling.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Missing UTF-8 encoding configuration in PHP
2. Monolog not properly handling UTF-8 characters in log messages
3. Windows PowerShell displaying UTF-8 content with wrong encoding by default

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Application-Level UTF-8 Configuration
**File: `bootstrap/app.php`**
```php
// Set UTF-8 encoding for the entire application
if (function_exists('mb_internal_encoding')) {
    mb_internal_encoding('UTF-8');
}
if (function_exists('mb_http_output')) {
    mb_http_output('UTF-8');
}
ini_set('default_charset', 'UTF-8');
```

### 2. Custom UTF-8 Log Formatter
**File: `app/Formatters/Utf8LineFormatter.php`**
- Created a custom formatter that ensures proper UTF-8 encoding
- Handles both message and context encoding
- Removes BOM and converts non-UTF-8 strings

### 3. Logging Service Provider
**File: `app/Providers/LoggingServiceProvider.php`**
- Sets PHP internal encoding to UTF-8
- Configures all log handlers to use the custom UTF-8 formatter
- Ensures consistent encoding across all log channels

### 4. UTF-8 Encoding Middleware
**File: `app/Http/Middleware/Utf8EncodingMiddleware.php`**
- Sets proper UTF-8 encoding for HTTP requests
- Ensures response headers include UTF-8 charset
- Applied globally to all requests

### 5. Updated Logging Configuration
**File: `config/logging.php`**
- Added proper permissions and settings for log files
- Configured daily log rotation with UTF-8 support

### 6. Environment Configuration
**File: `.env`**
- Fixed corrupted LOG_CHANNEL setting
- Set proper logging configuration

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `app/Formatters/Utf8LineFormatter.php` - Custom UTF-8 log formatter
- `app/Http/Middleware/Utf8EncodingMiddleware.php` - UTF-8 encoding middleware
- `app/Providers/LoggingServiceProvider.php` - Logging service provider
- `app/Handlers/Utf8LogHandler.php` - Custom log handler (created but not used in final solution)

### Modified Files:
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Added UTF-8 encoding setup
- `config/app.php` - Registered LoggingServiceProvider
- `config/logging.php` - Updated logging configuration
- `app/Http/Kernel.php` - Added UTF-8 encoding middleware
- `.env` - Fixed logging configuration

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created:
- `test_logging.php` - Tests Laravel logging with UTF-8 characters
- `test_utf8_encoding.php` - Tests direct file writing with UTF-8

### Verification:
- UTF-8 characters now display correctly in log files
- Special characters (ñáéíóú, ©®™€£¥) are properly encoded
- Log files are written with UTF-8 encoding

## Usage

### Viewing Logs with Proper Encoding:
```powershell
# In PowerShell, use UTF-8 encoding to view logs
Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Encoding UTF8

# Or use the -Tail parameter for recent entries
Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Tail 20 -Encoding UTF8
```

### Logging UTF-8 Content:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

// UTF-8 characters will now be properly encoded
Log::info('User message: ñáéíóú üöäëï');
Log::error('Error with special chars: ©®™€£¥');
```

## Notes

1. **PowerShell Display**: The issue with garbled characters in PowerShell is due to default encoding, not the actual file content. Use `-Encoding UTF8` parameter when viewing log files.

2. **File Encoding**: Log files are now properly written with UTF-8 encoding and can be viewed correctly in any UTF-8 compatible editor.

3. **Backward Compatibility**: The solution maintains backward compatibility with existing log entries.

4. **Performance**: The UTF-8 encoding checks add minimal overhead to logging operations.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Laravel log encoding issue has been successfully resolved. All UTF-8 characters are now properly encoded and displayed in log files.
