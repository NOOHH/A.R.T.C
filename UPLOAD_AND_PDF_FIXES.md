# File Upload and PDF Viewer Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **File Upload Validation Error (422)**
**Problem**: "The attachment failed to upload" error during content upload

**Improvements Made in AdminModuleController.php**:
- âœ… Enhanced file upload error handling with detailed error messages
- âœ… Added proper error code detection and logging
- âœ… Better validation error responses with specific error details
- âœ… File storage verification before proceeding

**Error handling now covers**:
- File size limits (server and form)
- Partial uploads
- Missing temporary directories
- Disk write failures
- Extension restrictions
- Unknown upload errors

### 2. **PDF Inline Viewer Enhancement**
**Problem**: PDFs still showing as download buttons instead of inline viewing

**Improvements Made in student-course.blade.php**:
- âœ… Enhanced loadPdfContent() function with better debugging
- âœ… Improved PDFObject implementation with progressive fallbacks
- âœ… Better error handling and user feedback
- âœ… Console logging for debugging PDF loading issues

**PDF Viewer Features**:
1. **PDFObject Primary**: Uses PDFObject library for best experience
2. **iframe Fallback**: Falls back to iframe if PDFObject fails
3. **Download Fallback**: Provides download links if viewing fails
4. **Console Debugging**: Logs each step for troubleshooting
5. **Loading States**: Shows proper loading indicators

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
**Added comprehensive logging**:
- File upload process tracking
- PDF loading step-by-step logging
- Error state identification
- Browser compatibility checks

## Testing Steps

### File Upload Test:
1. Go to admin modules page
2. Try uploading a PDF file
3. Check console for detailed error messages if upload fails
4. Verify file appears in storage/app/public/content/

### PDF Viewer Test:
1. Go to student course page
2. Click on a PDF content item
3. Check browser console for PDF loading logs:
   - "ðŸ“„ Loading PDF content: [contentId]"
   - "ðŸ“„ PDF URL: [url]"
   - "ðŸ“„ PDFObject available: true/false"
   - "ðŸ“„ Using PDFObject to embed PDF" or fallback messages

### Expected Results:
- âœ… File uploads work without 422 errors
- âœ… PDFs display inline without download prompts
- âœ… Graceful fallbacks for incompatible browsers
- âœ… Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

## Common File Upload Issues & Solutions

1. **File too large**: Check php.ini settings (upload_max_filesize, post_max_size)
2. **Permission issues**: Ensure storage/app/public is writable
3. **Extension restrictions**: Verify file type is in allowed MIME types
4. **Server limits**: Check web server upload limits

## PDF Viewer Troubleshooting

1. **PDFObject not loading**: Check browser console for CDN errors
2. **iframe blocking**: Some browsers block PDF iframes - provides download fallback
3. **CORS issues**: Ensure PDF files are served from same domain
4. **File path issues**: Verify storage symlink is created (`php artisan storage:link`)

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for detailed error logs
2. Verify file permissions on storage directory
3. Test with different file sizes and types
4. Check PHP error logs for server-side issues
